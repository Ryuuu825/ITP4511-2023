## Background

EPL operates five venues in Hong Kong, providing rental venue services to its members for event organization. The current booking process is done in person or by phone reservation, with records manually recorded in a notebook. This method is error-prone and inefficient for senior management to assess the utilization rate of each venue and booking attendance of each member. EPL is looking for IT consultants to digitalize the system to improve efficiency, real-time record verification, and generate statistical reports.
